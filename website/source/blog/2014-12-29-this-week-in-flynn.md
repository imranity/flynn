title: "This Week in Flynn"
date: December 29, 2014

We deployed many great bug fixes last week, aided by the Go race detector. Running that tool against our Continuous Integration system helped close a longstanding issue with iptables and many small races and leaks.

We've had several requests to add buildpack caching to Flynn, and that change landed last week. Regular deploys of your apps should run much more quickly now.

Thanks to some improvement in etcd 2.0rc1, we've also added `flynn-host init`, which brings some important tooling for clusters. The commands are well-documented in code, but please [let us know](mailto:contact@flynn.io) if something doesn't make sense.

## Changes

* Buildpack builds now cache dependencies between deploys, causing significant speedups.
* We upgraded to etcd 2.0rc1 and added the `flynn-host init` command which makes
  it much easier to configure clusters correctly.
