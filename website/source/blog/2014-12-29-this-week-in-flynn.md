## Changes

We pushed many bug fixes last week, aided by the Go race detector. Running that tool against our Continuous Integration system helped fix many small races and leaks.

We've had several requests to add buildpack caching to Flynn, and that change landed last week. Regular deploys of your apps should run much more quickly now.

Thanks to some improvements in etcd 2.0rc1, we've also added `flynn-host init`, which makes configuring clusters more reliable.
